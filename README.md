# Take away game
The goal of this project is to create a two player game called `take away`.
The game consists of one or more piles. Each pile contains a random number of stones.

A player may remove any number of stones from **a single pile**
when it is their turn.
The player who removes the last stone(s) wins.

# Basic Gameplay
- When it is a player's turn they must remove at least 1 stone
- A player cannot remove more stones than are in a single pile
- A player may remove stones only from 1 pile per turn


# Play Options
   `-h` to display `h`elp text and exit.
   `-c` to play against the `c`omputer. (Default = false).
   `-p` to set an exact number of `p`iles.
   `-s` to set an exact number of `s`tones in each pile.
   
   Max values for piles and stones: 99
   Min values for piles and stones: 1
